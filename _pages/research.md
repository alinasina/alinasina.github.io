**Scientific Statement**: <br />

* **What:** Parameter estimation and fault diagnosis based on power electronics. The research is  related to modeling, optimized algorithm, signal processing and PCB design. Buck converter is the most basic PWM circuit that is suited for scientific research. Therefore, Buck circuit is commonly used as an object of parameter estimation. Common parameters include capacitance, inductance, resistor and power switches electrical parameters. Now, ESR and capacitance of AEC estimation are now my focusing point. As we all know, a 20% decrease of capacitance and 2 or 3 times ESR means the failure of ACE. However, these two parameters are important but difficult to estimate due to hardware burden and online parameter estimations.  Our methods have  been given to solve above problems. Hopefully, the proposed method could be applied into any topology.
*  **Why:** Parameter estimation and power electronics are both my favorite contents. Software programming and hardware design embody the whole system is comprehensive. Meanwhile, it is challenging because more time and energy will be consumed into the entire process. More and more software should be learned and electrical components can be soldered. For me, it is worth doing these kinds of research and I'd like to devote myself to the scientific and try to find something interesting that is significant in our area.
* **How:** Repetition and innovation are both quite important which make things perfect. 
* **Future plan:** TBC
